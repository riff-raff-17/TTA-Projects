**L4T1**

This project is a Python-based chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user input. It includes: basic conversational features using pattern-based responses, NLTK-powered sentiment analysis to detect user emotions, and integration with the UGOT robot to trigger physical actions based on the conversation. The chatbot can understand user sentiment and adjust its responses or robot behavior accordingly, creating a more interactive and engaging experience.

**L4T2**

This project is a simple introduction to Pygame, a popular Python library for creating 2D games. It covers the basic setup, event handling, game loop, and rendering. The goal of this project is to understand the core concepts of Pygame by building a basic game loop, handling events, drawing shapes, and controlling the frame rate.
