    "#### A little history:\n",
    "Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some reasons to learn Python:\n",
    "* Straightforward syntax makes it beginner-friendly\n",
    "* Same code runs on multiple platforms\n",
    "* Extensive libraries: Python is very commonly used in applications ranging from physical sciences to finance to machine learning\n",
    "* Large community: abundant resources are available online\n",
    "* It really is EVERYWHERE\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some cons that you may hear about Python:\n",
    "* (Potentially) Slower than compiled languages\n",
    "* Higher memory consumption\n",
    "* Some issues with multithreading"
